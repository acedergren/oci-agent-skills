# A++ Skill Test Criteria (120/120)

## D1: Knowledge Delta (20/20)
- [ ] Zero "what is X" explanations
- [ ] Zero tutorials for standard operations
- [ ] Every paragraph is Expert knowledge (not Activation or Redundant)
- [ ] Has decision trees for non-obvious choices
- [ ] Has trade-offs only experts would know
- [ ] Includes edge cases from real-world experience

## D2: Mindset + Procedures (15/15)
- [ ] Has "Before doing X, ask yourself..." frameworks
- [ ] Transfers thinking patterns (how to think about problems)
- [ ] Includes domain-specific procedures Claude wouldn't know
- [ ] Has Knowledge Gap Disclaimer
- [ ] Clear what Claude DOES vs DOESN'T know

## D3: Anti-Pattern Quality (15/15)
- [ ] Has explicit NEVER list (minimum 6 items)
- [ ] Each NEVER is specific (not vague)
- [ ] Each NEVER includes WHY (non-obvious reason)
- [ ] Each NEVER includes COST IMPACT (dollar amount)
- [ ] Anti-patterns are things "only experience teaches"

## D4: Specification Compliance (15/15)

- [ ] description is specific enough for agent to know when to use

## D5: Progressive Disclosure (15/15)
- [ ] SKILL.md < 500 lines (ideal < 400)
- [ ] Has references/ directory with detailed content
- [ ] Loading triggers embedded in workflow (WHEN TO LOAD)
- [ ] Has "Do NOT Load" guidance
- [ ] Heavy content moved to references

## D6: Freedom Calibration (15/15)

- [ ] Specific cost formulas, not estimates
- [ ] Decision trees with clear paths

## D7: Pattern Recognition (10/10)
- [ ] Follows appropriate pattern (Tool/Process/Mindset)
- [ ] Consistent structure throughout
- [ ] Clear sections (NEVER, Decision Trees, References, When to Use)

## D8: Practical Usability (15/15)
