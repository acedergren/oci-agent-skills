# Network Security Groups

The Networking service offers two virtual firewall features to control traffic at the packet level:

- **Network security groups:** Covered in this topic. Network security groups (NSGs) are supported only for [specific services](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/networksecuritygroups.htm#support).
- **Security lists:** The original type of virtual firewall offered by the Networking service. See [Security Lists](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securitylists.htm).

Both of these features use _security rules_. For important information about how security rules work, and a general comparison of security lists and network security groups, see [Security Rules](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm).

**Note**

You can use Zero Trust Packet Routing (ZPR) along with or in place of network security groups to manage network access to OCI
**resources**. To do this, define ZPR policies that govern how resources communicate with each other, and then add security attributes to those resources. For more information, see [Zero Trust Packet Routing](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/zero-trust-packet-routing/home.htm).

**Caution**

If an endpoint has a Zero Trust Packet Routing (ZPR) security attribute, traffic to the endpoint must satisfy ZPR policies and also all NSG and security list rules. For example, if you're already using NSGs and you add a security attribute to an endpoint, all traffic to the endpoint is blocked. From then onward, a ZPR policy must explicitly allow traffic to the endpoint.

## Highlights 🔗

- Network security groups (NSGs) act as a virtual firewall for Compute instances and [other kinds of resources](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm#comparison). An NSG consists of a set of ingress and egress [security rules](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm) that apply only to _a set of VNICs in a single VCN_ (for example: all the Compute instances that act as web servers in the web tier of a multitier application in a VCN).
- Compared to security lists, NSGs let you separate a VCN's subnet architecture from the application security requirements. See [Comparison of Security Lists and Network Security Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm#comparison).
- You can use NSGs with certain resource types. For more information, see [Support for Network Security Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/networksecuritygroups.htm#support).
- NSG security rules function the same as security list rules. However, for an NSG security rule's source (for ingress rules) or destination (for egress rules), you can specify an NSG instead of a CIDR. This means you can easily write security rules to control traffic between two NSGs _in the same VCN_, or traffic within a single NSG. See [Parts of a Security Rule](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm#sec_rules_parts).
- Unlike with security lists, the VCN doesn't have a default NSG. Also, each NSG you create is initially empty. It has no default security rules.
- Network security groups have separate and different limits compared to security lists. See [Security List Limits](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm#sec_list_limits).

## Support for Network Security Groups 🔗

NSGs are available for you to create and use. However, they're not yet supported by all the relevant Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services.

The following types of [parent resources](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm#comparison) support the use of NSGs:

- **Autonomous Recovery Service** (Subnets for Recovery Service): When you [register a Recovery Service subnet](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/recovery-service/doc/register-recovery-subnet.html), you can associate one or more NSGs (maximum five) that contain the ingress rules for Recovery Service.
- **Compute instances:** When you create an instance, you can specify one or more NSGs for the instance's primary VNIC. If you add a secondary VNIC to an instance, you can specify one or more NSGs for that VNIC. You can also update existing VNICs on an instance so that they're in one or more NSGs.
- **Load balancers:** When you create a Load Balancer, you can specify one or more NSGs for the Load Balancer (not the backend set). You can also update an existing Load Balancer to use one or more NSGs.
- **DB systems:** When you create a DB system, you can specify one or more NSGs. You can also update an existing DB system to use one or more NSGs.
- **Autonomous AI Databases:** When you create an Autonomous AI Database on dedicated Exadata infrastructure, you can specify one or more NSGs for the infrastructure resource.
- **Mount targets:** When you create a mount target for a file system, you can specify one or more NSGs. You can also update an existing mount target to use one or more NSGs.
- **DNS resolver endpoint:** When you create an endpoint for a [private DNS resolver](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/dns-topic-Private-resolver.htm "A private DNS resolver answers DNS queries for a VCN per a configuration you create."), you can
specify one or more NSGs. You can also update an existing endpoint to use one or
more NSGs.
- **Kubernetes clusters:** When you [create a Kubernetes cluster](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengcreatingclusterusingoke_topic-Using_the_Console_to_create_a_Custom_Cluster_with_Explicitly_Defined_Settings.htm) using Kubernetes Engine, you can specify one or more NSGs to control access to the Kubernetes API endpoint and to worker nodes. You can also specify NSGs when [defining a load balancer for a cluster](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengconfiguringloadbalancersnetworkloadbalancers-subtopic.htm#contengcreatingloadbalancer_topic_Specifying_Load_Balancer_Network_Security_Group).
- **API gateways:** When you [create an API gateway](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/APIGateway/Tasks/apigatewaycreatinggateway.htm), you can specify one or more NSGs to control access to the API gateway.
- **Functions:** When you [set up an application](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Functions/Tasks/functionsusingnsgs.htm) in OCI Functions, you can specify one or more NSGs to define ingress and egress rules that apply to all the functions in that particular application.
- **GoldenGate deployments:** When you [create\\
a GoldenGate deployment](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/goldengate-service/llyhq/#GUID-899C1348-58CA-43EE-B775-EAD3B365A7A9), you can specify one or more NSGs to control
access to the deployment.
- **Redis clusters:** When you [create a Redis cluster](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/ocicache/createcluster.htm), you can specify one or more NSGs to control
access to the Redis cluster. You can also update an existing cluster to use one or
more NSGs

For resource types that don't yet support NSGs, continue to use security lists to control traffic in and out of those parent resources.

## Overview of Network Security Groups 🔗

A network security group (NSG) provides a virtual firewall for a set of cloud resources that all have the same security posture. For example: a group of Compute instances that all perform the same tasks and thus all need to use the same set of ports.

An NSG consists of two types of items:

- **VNICs:** One or more [VNICs](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVNICs.htm) (for example, the VNICs attached to the set of Compute instances that all have the same security posture). All the VNICs must be in the same VCN as the NSG. Also see [Comparison of Security Lists and Network Security Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm#comparison).
- **Security rules:** The NSG's [Security rules](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm) define the types of traffic allowed in and out of the VNICs in the group. For example: ingress TCP port 22 SSH traffic from a particular source.

If you have resources with different security postures _in the same VCN_, you can write NSG security rules to control traffic between the resources with one posture compared to another. For example, in the following diagram, NSG1 has VNICs running in one tier of a multitier architecture application. NSG2 has VNICs running in a second tier. Both NSGs must belong to the same VCN. The assumption is that both NSGs need to start connections to the other NSG.

For NSG1, you set up egress security rules that specify NSG2 as the destination, and ingress security rules that specify NSG2 as the source. Likewise for NSG2, you set up egress security rules that specify NSG1 as the destination, and ingress security rules that specify NSG1 as the source. The rules are assumed to be [stateful](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm#stateful) in this example.

[![You can set up security rules to control traffic between two network security groups.](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Images/network_nsg_two_tiers.svg)](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Images/network_nsg_two_tiers.svg)

The preceding diagram assumes that each NSG needs to start connections to the other NSG.

The next diagram assumes that you instead want to only allow connections started from NSG1 to NSG2. To do that, remove the ingress rule from NSG1 and the egress rule from NSG2. The remaining rules don't allow connections started from NSG2 to NSG1.

[![These security rules allow connections started in only one direction: from NSG1 to NSG2.](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Images/network_nsg_two_tiers_one_direction.svg)](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Images/network_nsg_two_tiers_one_direction.svg)

The next diagram assumes that you want to control traffic between VNICs _in the same NSG_. To do that, set the rule's source (for ingress) or destination (for egress) as the rule's own NSG.

[![You can set up security rules to control traffic between VNICs in the same NSG.](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Images/network_nsg_same_nsg.svg)](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Images/network_nsg_same_nsg.svg)

A VNIC can be in a maximum of five NSGs. A packet in question is allowed if _any rule in any of the VNIC's NSGs_ allows the traffic (or if the traffic is part of an existing connection being tracked), unless the lists happen to contain both stateful and stateless security rules that cover the same traffic. For more information, see [Stateful Compared to Stateless Rules](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm#stateful).

Network security groups are regional entities. For limits related to network security groups, see [Comparison of Security Lists and Network Security Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm#comparison).

See [Network Security Group Limits](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm#nsg_limits) and [Requesting a Service Limit Increase](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits-request-increase.htm) for limits-related information.

## Security Rules 🔗

If you're not yet familiar with the basics of NSG security rules, see these sections in the security rules topic:

- [Parts of a Security Rule](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm#sec_rules_parts)
- [Stateful Compared to Stateless Rules](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm#stateful)

## Using the API 🔗

For information about using the API and signing requests, see [REST API documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/usingapi.htm) and [Security Credentials](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/credentials.htm). For information about SDKs, see [SDKs and the CLI](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdks.htm).

For information about using the API and signing requests, see [REST API documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/usingapi.htm) and [Security Credentials](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/credentials.htm). For information about SDKs, see [SDKs and the CLI](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdks.htm).

Some differences in the REST API model for NSGs compared to security lists:

- Security lists have an `IngressSecurityRule` object and a separate `EgressSecurityRule` object. Network security groups only have a `SecurityRule` object, and the object's `direction` attribute shows whether the rule is for ingress or egress traffic.
- With security lists, the rules are part of the `SecurityList` object, and you work with the rules by calling the security list operations (such as `UpdateSecurityList`). With NSGs, the rules aren't part of the `NetworkSecurityGroup` object. Instead you use separate operations to work with the rules for a particular NSG (example: `UpdateNetworkSecurityGroupSecurityRules`).
- The model for _updating_ existing security rules is different between security lists and NSGs. With NSGs, each rule in a particular group has a unique Oracle-assigned identifier (example: 04ABEC). When you call `UpdateNetworkSecurityGroupSecurityRules`, you provide the IDs of the specific rules that you want to update. For comparison, with security lists, the rules have no unique identifier. When you call `UpdateSecurityList`, you must pass in the _entire_ list of rules, including rules that aren't being updated in the call.
- Security rules a limit of 25 rules when calling the operations to add, remove, or update.

## Working with Network Security Groups 🔗

### General Process for Working with NSGs

1. Create an NSG.
2. Add security rules to the NSG.
3. Add parent resources (such as VNICs) to the NSG. You can do this when you create the parent resource, or you can update the parent resource and add it to one or more NSGs. When you create a Compute instance and add it to an NSG, the instance's primary VNIC is added to the NSG. Separately, you can create secondary VNICs and optionally add them to NSGs.

### Deleting NSGs  🔗

To [delete an NSG](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/delete_nsg.htm "Delete a network security group (NSG) from a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)."), it must not contain any VNICs or parent resources. When a parent resource (or a Compute instance VNIC) is deleted, it's automatically removed from the NSGs it was in. You might not have permission to delete a particular parent resource. Contact the tenancy administrator to find who owns a particular resource.

### Required IAM Policy

To use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, an administrator must be a member of a group granted security access in a **policy** by a tenancy administrator. This access is required whether you're using the Console or the REST API with an SDK, CLI, or other tool. If you get a message that you don't have permission or are unauthorized, verify with the tenancy administrator what type of access you have and which **compartment** your access works in.

For administrators: The policy in [Let network admins manage a cloud network](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm#network-admins-manage-cloud-network) covers management of all Networking components, including NSGs.

If you have security admins who need to manage NSGs but
not other components in the Networking service, you
could write a more restrictive policy:

Copy

```
Allow group NSGAdmins to manage network-security-groups in tenancy

Allow group NSGAdmins to manage vcns in tenancy
      where ANY {request.operation = 'CreateNetworkSecurityGroup',
                 request.operation = 'DeleteNetworkSecurityGroup'}

Allow group NSGAdmins to read vcns in tenancy

Allow group NSGAdmins to use VNICs in tenancy
```

The first statement lets the NSGAdmins group create and manage NSGs
and their security rules.

The second statement is required because the creation or deletion of an NSG affects the VCN that the NSG is in. The statement restricts the VCN-related permissions to only those required to create or delete an NSG. The statement doesn't allow the NSGAdmins group to create or delete VCNs, or work with any resources in a VCN except NSGs.

The third statement is required for listing the VCNs, which is a prerequisite for creating or deleting an NSG in a VCN. For information about why _both_ the second and third statements are required, see [Conditions](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/policiesadvfeatures/policyadvancedfeatures.htm#conditions).

The fourth statement is required if the NSGAdmins need to put VNICs into an NSG.
Whoever creates the parent resource of the VNIC (for example, a Compute instance) must already have this level of
permission to create the parent resource.

For more information about Networking service policies,
see [IAM Policies for Networking](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/overview.htm#Policies).

## About Network Security Groups and  Security Lists

The Networking service in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) offers two
virtual firewall features to control traffic at the packet level: network security
groups and security lists.


- Network security groups (NSGs): Act as a virtual firewall for
OCI resources such as Oracle Analytics Cloud. An NSG consists of a set of ingress
and egress security rules that apply only to a set of VNICs of your choice in a
single VCN. To learn more about NSGs and how to manage ingress and egress security
rules, see [Network Security Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/networksecuritygroups.htm).

- Security lists: The original type of virtual firewall offered by the
Networking service. See [Security Lists](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securitylists.htm#Security_Lists).


Either option or a combination of these two features can be used. See [Comparison of Security Lists and Network\\
Security Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm#comparison).

I decided to write this blog post because I received multiple customer requests asking for differences between NSGs and SLs, where and when to use one or another or both and the best practices.

NSGs stands for Network Security Groups, a security mechanism that we have added to OCI few time back.

NSGs can be more granular in terms of security and can be used with or without Security Lists, You can follow the link from OCI public documentation to find more about NSGs vs SL: [https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm)

In the next part of the blog a case will be presented and includes both the NSGs and SLs implementing different security postures.

## The Case

We have three servers in **the same subnet** in OCI: **A (129.213.96.139)**, **B (129.213.102.85)**, **C (129.213.39.46)**. The request is:

a) All there servers to permit SSH on port TCP 22;

b) Only server A to allow ICMP;

Using only Security Lists is not possible to accomplish the above points because the ingress security entries from the Security List will be activated on all the vnics from the subnet. So, let’s introduce the NSGs.

The Security List associated with the subnet containing A,B,C servers has an entry to permit the SSH (all three servers will be served by this security entry):

![](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/134/2025/11/1-26.png)

5.12.241.136 is the IP address permitted to access the three servers via SSH:

SSH to server A – connection accepted:

![](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/134/2025/11/3-23.png)

SSH to server B – connection accepted:

![](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/134/2025/11/4-20.png)

SSH to server C – connection accepted:

![](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/134/2025/11/5-19.png)

Using the security entry from the Security List associated with the subnet we have accomplished point a).

For point b) a Network Security Group is needed and i **nclude only the vnic of server A**. In this NSG an ingress rule will be added to permit the ICMP from 5.12.241.136:

![](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/134/2025/11/2-24.png)

If we try to ping all the three servers the ICMP will be successful only to server A:

![](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/134/2025/11/6-20.png)

We have accomplished also point b) and we have solved the case.

There is not an issue if we used Security Lists in the first place. We can add NGS in the picture with the observation that if we want to have a granular filtering we need to make sure that a specific security entry that needs to be applied on a specific server or group of servers in the same subnet exists only as a rule in the NSG and not in the Security List associated with the subnet.

On the other hand the NSGs can be used also between subnets or matching a specific service like OCI Object Storage or all services from Oracle Services Network.

NSGs will give the ability create a more granular security between On-premise and OCI or inside the cloud VCN and from this reason the preferred method is to use  the NSGs as much as possible.

_**\[July 10, 2019\]**_ Oracle released a new update in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) that allows you to create **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** used to implement security rules in your **Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)**.

The OCI Networking service offers two virtual firewall features:

- **Security Lists (SL):** The original virtual firewall feature from the Networking service.
- **Network Security Groups:** A subsequent feature designed for application components that have different security postures.

These two features offer different ways to apply security rules to a set of Virtual Network Interface Cards(VNICs) in the Virtual Cloud Network(VCN).

In this blog post, we discuss the **Differences** between **Network Security Groups and** **Security List.** Also, we tell you **When to use what.**

## **Overview Of Network Security Groups**

Network Security Groups are another method for implementing security rules. NSGs provide a virtual firewall for a set of Cloud resources that have the same security posture.

NSGs consist of two types of items:

- **VNICs:** One or more VNICs (for example, the VNICs attached to a set of Compute instances have the same security posture). All the VNICs must be in the VCN that the NSGs belong to.
- **Security rules:** **[Security rules](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm)** define the types of traffic allowed in and out of the VNICs in the group. For example, ingress TCP port 22 SSH traffic from a particular source.

### **Resources That Support Network Security Groups:**

- Compute instances
- Load balancers
- DB systems
- Autonomous Databases

_**Note:** For resource types that do not support NSGs yet, continue to use security lists to control traffic in and out of those parent resources._

## **Overview Of Security List**

A Security List acts as a virtual firewall for an instance with ingress and egress rules that specify the types of traffic allowed in and out. Security lists are regional entities.

Security List allows two types of traffic:

- **Ingress**: Incoming Traffic
- **Egress**: Outgoing Traffic

## **Comparison Of** **Network Security Groups A** **nd** **Security List**

- **_A Security list_** lets you define a set of security rules that applies to **all the VNICs** in a _**subnet** whereas **Network Security Groups** let you define a set of security rules that applies to a group of VNICs of your choice._
- **NSGs’ security rules** apply _only to the resources in that NSG_. By contrast, **Security Lists’** rules apply to all the resources _in a subnet that uses the list_.
- **NSGs** consist of a set of ingress and egress security rules that apply only to _a set of VNICs of your choice in a single VCN._
- Unlike with **Security List**, the VCN does not have a default **NSGs**. Also, the **NSGs** you create are initially empty. They have no default security rules.
- A Security List is used at the **packet level.**
- NSGs are another way to implement security rules.
- **Security Lists** have separate and different limits compared to the **Network Security Groups**.

**![NSGVS SL](https://k21academy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/network_nsg_comparison.png)**_**Note:** Oracle recommends using NSGs instead of Security Lists because NSGs let you separate the VCN’s subnet architecture from your application security requirements._

## **When To Use What?**

**Security Lists** provide comprehensive security to applications with security rules applied to every subnet. But if you have **multiple resources** that require different **security postures** within a subnet, and you need to control the traffic at a more granular application level, then you can create those granular rules and add **multiple resources to them** using **Network Security Groups.**

_**In this diagram**_, you have a _3-tier_ web application in which the web/proxy tier is deployed in the **public subnet,** and the **application** and the **database** **tiers** are deployed in the private subnet. To secure the application tier, you can create granular security rules to control the traffic that enters the application and then apply the same rules to the application **VNICs**.

I started my IT career in 2000 as an Oracle DBA/Apps DBA. The first few years were tough (<0/month), with very little growth.

In 2004, I moved to the UK. After working really hard, I landed a job that paid me £2700 per month.

In February 2005, I saw a job that was £450 per day, which was nearly 4 times of my then salary.

- Use Network Security Groups to Control Traffic to Compute Instances

Risk Level: High (not acceptable risk)

Ensure that your OCI compute instances are associated with Network Security Groups (NSGs), which operate as a virtual firewall for resources by containing a set of security rules that control the allowed types of inbound and outbound traffic. Network Security Groups use ingress and egress security rules that are applied to defined Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs) within a single Virtual Cloud Network (VCN).

![security](https://www.trendmicro.com/cloudoneconformity/assets/v2/images/icons/security.svg?1769571368888118393)Security

Use Network Security Groups (NSGs) with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) compute instances to achieve granular, resource-level network security and isolation, which is superior to the subnet-wide rules of OCI security lists. With NSGs, you can limit the attack surface and ensure only authorized clients and services can communicate with your OCI compute instances.

# Controlling Traffic with Security Lists

On Private Cloud Appliance, both security lists and network security groups (NSGs) are types of virtual firewalls for your compute instances. Both security lists and NSGs define network security rules that decide which types of traffic are allowed in and out of instances (VNICs).

Security lists provide virtual firewall rules to all the VNICs in a subnet. To provide a set
of firewall rules for a set of VNICs of your choice in a VCN, you can create an NSG. See [Controlling Traffic with Network Security Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/private-cloud-appliance/cmn/network/controlling-traffic-with-network-security-groups.htm#controlling-traffic-with-network-security-groups "On Private Cloud Appliance, both network security groups (NSGs) and security lists are types of virtual firewalls for your compute instances. Both NSGs and security lists define network security rules that decide which types of traffic are allowed in and out of instances (VNICs).").

Security lists enable you to define network security rules that apply to all VNICs in a
subnet. A default security list is automatically created for each VCN. That default security
list is assigned to each subnet in the VCN if you don't assign a different security list. Up
to five security lists can be associated with a subnet.

If you use both security lists and NSGs, traffic in or out of a given VNIC is allowed if any
rule in any applicable security list or NSG allows the traffic:

- Any rule in any security list that's associated with the VNIC subnet

- Any rule in any NSG that the VNIC is in


For more information about security lists, see [Security Lists](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/private-cloud-appliance/cmn/network/security-lists.htm#security-lists "On Private Cloud Appliance, a security list acts as a virtual firewall for an instance, with ingress and egress rules that specify the types of traffic allowed in and out.").

# Security Lists

The Networking service offers two virtual firewall features to control traffic at the packet level:

- **Security lists:** Covered in this topic. This is the original type of virtual firewall offered by the Networking service.
- **Network security groups:** Another type of virtual firewall that we recommend over security lists. See [Network Security Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/networksecuritygroups.htm).

Both of these features use _security rules_. For important information about how security rules work, and a general comparison of security lists and network security groups, see [Security Rules](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm).

## Highlights

- Security lists act as virtual firewalls for Compute instances and [other kinds of resources](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm#comparison). A security list consists of a set of ingress and egress [security rules](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm) that apply to all the VNICs _in any subnet that the security list is associated with_. This means that all the VNICs in a particular subnet are subject to the same set of security lists. See [Comparison of Security Lists and Network Security Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm#comparison).
- Security list rules function the same as network security group rules. For a discussion of rule parameters, see [Parts of a Security Rule](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm#sec_rules_parts).
- Each VCN comes with a [default security list](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securitylists.htm#Default) that has several default rules for essential traffic. If you don't specify a custom security list for a subnet, the default security list is automatically used with that subnet. You can add and remove rules from the default security list.
- Security lists have separate and different limits compared to network security groups. See [Comparison of Security Lists and Network Security Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm#comparison).

## Overview of Security Lists

A security list acts as a virtual firewall for an instance, with ingress and egress rules that specify the types of traffic allowed in and out. Each security list is enforced at the VNIC level. However, you configure security lists _at the subnet level_, which means that all VNICs in a subnet are subject to the same set of security lists. The security lists apply to a particular VNIC whether it's communicating with another instance in the VCN or a host outside the VCN.

Each subnet can have several security lists associated with it, and each list can have many rules (for the maximum number, see [Comparison of Security Lists and Network Security Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm#comparison)). A packet in question is allowed if _any rule in any of the lists_ allows the traffic (or if the traffic is part of an existing connection being tracked) unless the lists happen to contain both stateful and stateless rules that cover the same traffic. For more information, see [Stateful Compared to Stateless Rules](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm#stateful).

Security lists are regional entities. For limits related to security lists, see [Comparison of Security Lists and Network Security Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm#comparison).

Security lists can control both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. IPv6 addressing and related
security list rules are supported in all commercial and government regions. For more
information, see [IPv6 Addresses](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/ipv6.htm).

See [Security List Limits](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm#sec_list_limits) and [Requesting a Service Limit Increase](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits-request-increase.htm) for limits-related information.

## Default Security List

Unlike other security lists, the default security list comes with an initial set of stateful rules. We recommend changing these rules to only allow inbound traffic from authorized subnets relevant to the region that homes that VCN or subnet. A list of authorized subnet ranges relevant to each region can be found at [https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/tools/public\_ip\_ranges.json](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/tools/public_ip_ranges.json).

- **Stateful ingress:** Allow TCP traffic on destination port 22 (SSH) from authorized source IP addresses and any source port. This rule makes it easy for you to create a new cloud network and public subnet, create a Linux instance, and then immediately use SSH to connect to that instance without needing to write any security list rules yourself.

**Important**





The default security list doesn't include a rule to allow Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access. If you're using [Windows images](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/References/images.htm), ensure that you add a stateful ingress rule for TCP traffic on destination port 3389 from authorized source IP addresses and any source port.



See [To enable RDP access](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/launchinginstance.htm#prerequisites__enablerdp) for more information.

- **Stateful ingress:** Allow ICMP traffic type 3 code 4 from authorized source IP addresses. This rule enables Compute instances to receive Path MTU Discovery fragmentation messages.
- **Stateful ingress:** Allow ICMP traffic type 3 (all codes) from the VCN's CIDR block. This rule makes it easy for Compute instances to receive connectivity error messages from other instances within the VCN.
- **Stateful egress:** Allow all traffic. This lets instances start traffic of any kind to any destination. Notice that this means the instances with public IP addresses can talk to any internet IP address if the VCN has a configured internet gateway. And because stateful security rules use connection tracking, the response traffic is automatically allowed regardless of any ingress rules. For more information, see [Stateful Compared to Stateless Rules](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm#stateful).

The default security list comes with no stateless rules. However, you can always add
or remove rules from the default security list.

If the VCN is enabled for IPv6 addressing the default security list contains some default rules for IPv6 traffic. For more information, see [Security Rules for IPv6 Traffic](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securitylists.htm#security_lists).

### Enabling Ping

The default security list doesn't include a rule to allow ping requests. If you plan to ping an instance, see [Rules to Handle Fragmented UDP Packets](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm#fragudp).

### Security Rules for IPv6 Traffic

The VCN's [network security groups](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/networksecuritygroups.htm) and [security lists](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm) support both IPv4 and IPv6 [security rules](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm). For example, a network security group or security list could have these security rules:

- Rule to allow SSH traffic from the on-premises network's IPv4 CIDR
- Rule to allow ping traffic from the on-premises network's IPv4 CIDR
- Rule to allow SSH traffic from the on-premises network's **IPv6** prefix
- Rule to allow ping traffic from the on-premises network's **IPv6** prefix

The [default security list](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securitylists.htm#Default) in an IPv6-enabled VCN includes default IPv4 rules and the following default IPv6 rules:

- **Stateful ingress:** Allow IPv6 TCP traffic on destination port 22 (SSH)
from source ::/0 and any source port. This rule makes it easy for you to create
a VCN with a public subnet and internet gateway, create a Linux instance, add an
internet-access-enabled IPv6, and then immediately connect with SSH to that
instance without needing to write any security rules yourself.

**Important**





The default security list doesn't include a rule to allow Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access. If you're using [Windows images](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/References/images.htm), add a stateful ingress rule for TCP traffic on destination port 3389 from source ::/0 and any source port.



See [To enable RDP access](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/launchinginstance.htm#prerequisites__enablerdp) for more information.

- **Stateful ingress:** Allow ICMPv6 traffic type 2 code 0 (Packet Too Big) from source ::/0 and any source port. This rule lets instances to receive Path MTU Discovery fragmentation messages.
- **Stateful egress:** Choosing to allow all IPv6 traffic lets instances start IPv6 traffic of any kind to any destination. Notice that instances with an internet-access-enabled IPv6 can talk to any internet IPv6 address if the VCN has a configured internet gateway. And because stateful security rules use connection tracking, the response traffic is automatically allowed regardless of any ingress rules. For more information, see [Stateful Compared to Stateless Rules](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm#stateful).

# Microsegementation with Network Security Groups

December 15, 20256 minute read

OCI Network Security Group rules function the same as Security List rules. But, you can specify another Network Security Group ( _NSG_) as the rule’s source or destination address instead of an IP CIDR. You can easily write security rules to control traffic between NSGs _within a VCN_. This allows for microsegementation between different application functions.

For example, a public-facing web service with backend app servers and a database. The public web server needs to allow inbound HTTP requests from external clients while the database needs additional security. Allowing access from specific app servers performing database queries generated by web clients searching a product catalog on the website. Rather than allowing an entire network or subnet access to the database, limit communication to specific resources by assigning them to a NSG.

Quickly deploy this scenario in your OCI environment with the following [Terraform stack](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-security-networking/tree/main/Networking/Automations/oci-nsg-microsegmentation)!

## **Use Case**

Let’s review an example based on the use case mentioned above. We’ll use a multi-tier design with one VCN and three separate subnets. Each subnet is its own tier. We’ll use network security groups, also known as NSGs to provide microsegmentation between the Web, App, and Database tiers.

![multi tier diagram](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/134/2025/11/Microsegmentation-with-Network-Security-Groups-Network-Design-ver3.png)

- The **Web NSG** allows HTTP traffic from any IP address, including the Internet.
- The **App NSG** will only accept traffic over TCP port 8080 from resources assigned to the **Web NSG**.
- The **DB NSG** will only allow SQL access to resources assigned to the **App NSG**.

_Note: VNICs are assigned to NSGs, not IP networks or IP addresses._

Looking in the OCI Console we have three NSGs named Web, App, & DB. Each NSG will be associated to a VNIC within its designated subnet. Going through each NSG notice the slight differences in each NSG security configuration.

![LIST OF NSGS SCREENSHOT](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/134/2025/11/LIST-OF-NSGS-SCREENSHOT.png)

**Web NSG**: The security rule allows incoming traffic from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0) over port 80. Any VNIC assigned to this NSG will allow this particular access:

![WEB NSG SCREENSHOT](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/134/2025/11/WEB-NSG-SCREENSHOT.png)

**App NSG**: Notice the Source or Destination column this security rule allows traffic to the custom TCP port 8080 from resources assigned to the **Web NSG**:

![APP NSG SCREENSHOT](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/134/2025/11/APP-NSG-SCREENSHOT.png)

**DB NSG**: Again take a look at the Source or Destination column the security rule will accept incoming SQL traffic only from resources assigned to the **App NSG**:

![DB NSG SCREENSHOT](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/134/2025/11/DB-NSG-SCREENSHOT.png)

The left VNIC menu in the NSG section allows you to view which VNICs are currently assigned to the NSG. I’ve attached the App instance located in the App Tier to the **App NSG**:

![APP NSG VNIC SCREENSHOT](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/134/2025/11/APP-NSG-VNIC-SCREENSHOT.png)

I’ve also attached the Private Endpoint in the Database Tier to the **DB NSG**.

![DB NSG VNIC SCREENSHOT](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/134/2025/11/DB-NSG-VNIC-SCREENSHOT.png)

Notice that the **Web NSG** currently has no VNICs assigned:

![WEB NSG VNIC SCREENSHOT 1](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/134/2025/11/WEB-NSG-VNIC-SCREENSHOT-1.png)

If I attempt to access the Web VM it will time out ( [_as shown in the companion video_](https://youtu.be/UCr1W2PsLHE?t=210)) due to missing security rules. Remember OCI Security Lists and NSGs uses an implicit deny policy. Only rules added to the Security List or NSG will allow the specified traffic.

To fix this issue I’ve assigned my Web instance VNIC to the **Web NSG**, once assigned I’m now able to access the website:

![WEB NSG ASSIGNED](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/134/2025/11/WEB-NSG-ASSIGNED.png)

![WEBSITE SCREENSHOT](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/134/2025/11/WEBSITE-SCREENSHOT.png)

Note that the Web instance now appears in the Web NSG VNIC menu:

![WEB NSG VNIC SCREENSHOT 2](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/134/2025/11/WEB-NSG-VNIC-SCREENSHOT-2.png)

Recall the App NSG only allows connectivity from resources assigned to the **Web NSG**. Additional testing shows that the Web Instance can access the App Instance over TCP 8080 now that it’s  attached to the **Web NSG**.

![APP ACCESS SCREENSHOT](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/134/2025/11/APP-ACCESS-SCREENSHOT.png)

Since the App instance VNIC is attached to the **App NSG** it has SQL ( _Port 1521_) access to the Autonomous Database. Remember the **DB NSG** only allows SQL connectivity from resources assigned to the `App NSG`.

![ADB ACCESS SCREENSHOT](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/134/2025/11/ADB-ACCESS-SCREENSHOT.png)

**Conclusion**

In this blog, we tested access to and from network security groups using a multi-tier architecture. Segmenting network traffic by application access needs. As you build out your VCN architecture take advantage of the flexibility NSGs provide. Such as assigning instances with different security postures in the same subnet with unrelated NSGs.

To learn more about NSGs please read our official OCI documents located [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/networksecuritygroups.htm).

Network Security Groups is a virtual firewall with a set of security rules (ingress and egress) applied only to a group of VNICs of choice in a single VCN for e.g. a group of compute instances that all perform the same tasks and thus all need to use the same set of ports.

**A Network Security Group consists of two types of items.**

**VNICs: –** One or more VNICs attached to the set of compute instances that all have the same security posture   . All the VNICs must be in the same VCN as the NSG

**Security rules: –** The NSG’s Security rules define the types of traffic allowed in and out of the VNICs in the group. For example: ingress TCP port 22 SSH traffic from a particular source.

**Security lists**

Whereas Security lists is a set of security rules that is applied to all the VNICs in an entire subnet. To use a given security list with a particular subnet, associate the security list with the subnet either during subnet creation or later. A subnet can be associated with a maximum of five security lists. Any VNICs that are created in that subnet are subject to the security lists associated with the subnet.

**Note:-**

- Oracle recommends using NSGs instead of security lists because NSGs separate the VCN’s subnet architecture from your application security requirements. However both can be used simultaneously at the same time.
- Security Lists provide comprehensive security to applications with security rules applied to every subnet. But if you have multiple resources that require different security postures within a subnet and you need to control the traffic at a more granular application level, then you can create those granular rules and add multiple resources to them using Network Security Groups.

**Adding or Removing a Resource from an Network Security Group**

1.. Create Network Security group **VCN-POC-NSG1** in VCN **VCN-POC**

[![](https://askmedawaa.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-1.png?w=940)](https://askmedawaa.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-1.png)

2..  When creating an instance, in the Networking section, under the advanced options, select the check box for Use network security groups to control traffic. Then, specify one or more NSGs (the instance’s primary VNIC is added to the NSGs)

3.. Removed **VCN-POC-Security-list** (ingress and egress) associated with subnet **VCN-POC-SUBNET** from VCN, **VCN-POC**

# Controlling Traffic with Security Lists

On Private Cloud Appliance, both security lists and network security groups (NSGs) are types of virtual firewalls for your compute instances. Both security lists and NSGs define network security rules that decide which types of traffic are allowed in and out of instances (VNICs).

Security lists provide virtual firewall rules to all the VNICs in a subnet. To provide a set
of firewall rules for a set of VNICs of your choice in a VCN, you can create an NSG. See [Controlling Traffic with Network Security Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/private-cloud-appliance/cmn/network/controlling-traffic-with-network-security-groups.htm#controlling-traffic-with-network-security-groups "On Private Cloud Appliance, both network security groups (NSGs) and security lists are types of virtual firewalls for your compute instances. Both NSGs and security lists define network security rules that decide which types of traffic are allowed in and out of instances (VNICs).").

Security lists enable you to define network security rules that apply to all VNICs in a
subnet. A default security list is automatically created for each VCN. That default security
list is assigned to each subnet in the VCN if you don't assign a different security list. Up
to five security lists can be associated with a subnet.

If you use both security lists and NSGs, traffic in or out of a given VNIC is allowed if any
rule in any applicable security list or NSG allows the traffic:

- Any rule in any security list that's associated with the VNIC subnet

- Any rule in any NSG that the VNIC is in


For more information about security lists, see [Security Lists](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/private-cloud-appliance/cmn/network/security-lists.htm#security-lists "On Private Cloud Appliance, a security list acts as a virtual firewall for an instance, with ingress and egress rules that specify the types of traffic allowed in and out.").
