# Overview of Generative AI Service

Generative AI is a fully managed Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service that provides a set of state-of-the-art, customizable large language models (LLMs) that cover a wide range of use cases, including chat, text generation, summarization, rerank, and creating text embeddings.

Use the [playground](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/use-playground.htm "The playground is an interface in the Oracle Cloud Console for exploring the hosted pretrained and custom models in OCI Generative AI without writing a single line of code. Use the playground to test your use cases and refine prompts and parameters. When you're happy with the results, integrate the generated code into your applications."), the API, or the CLI to try out
the ready-to-use pretrained models or create and host your own fine-tuned custom models based
on your own data on dedicated AI clusters.

The OCI
Generative AI service includes the following foundational models for chat, rerank, and text embeddings.

ChatAsk questions and get conversational responses through an AI chatbot.RerankInput a query and a list of texts and get an ordered array with each text assigned a relevance score. The relevance score is how the model ranks the documents, that's, how well each text matches the query.EmbeddingConvert text to vector embeddings to use in applications for semantic searches, recommender systems, text classification, or text clustering.

## Using the Pretrained Foundational Models 🔗

To get started, use the playground to try the pretrained foundational models. Run your prompts, adjust the parameters, update your prompts, and rerun the models until you're happy with the results. Then get the code from the Console and copy the code into your applications.

[![User workflow options for using the Generative AI service ready-to-use pretrained models.](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/images/scenario-1.png)](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/images/scenario-1.png)

## Fine-Tuning the Pretrained Models 🔗

You can create a copy of a pretrained foundational model, add your own training dataset, and let the OCI
Generative AI service fine-tune the model for you. OCI
Generative AI uses dedicated AI clusters specially sized for fine-tuning. These clusters belong only to your tenancy. After your model is fine-tuned, you create an endpoint for the custom model and host that model on a dedicated AI cluster that's designed for hosting. When you create the hosting cluster, select the correct pretrained model from which the fine-tuned model is derived from.

## Use Cases 🔗

Use the OCI
Generative AI service for the following types of use cases.

Text Generation

Use the pretrained chat models or text generation models to create text for any
purpose, for example:

- Pitch for a new product
- Slogan for a marketing campaign
- Sales email to a client
- Social media post
- Job description
- Title for an article

Conversation

You can ask questions in natural language and optionally submit text such as documents,
emails, and product reviews to the LLM and the LLM reasons over the text and provides
intelligent answers.

Data Extraction

Extract specific pieces of data from text, for example:

- Extract applicant information from an application written in free-form text.
- Extract dates or sums from a contract.
- Extract insights or trends from data tables.

Summarization

Generate executive summaries for documents that are too long to read, or summarize any type of text, for example:

- Documents
- Contracts
- Emails
- Articles
- Blog posts
- Product reviews
- Social media posts

Classification

Classify text into predefined categories, for example:

- Given a list of support tickets, classify them by the department that should handle them.
- Given a list of sectors and company names, classify the companies by their respective sectors.

Style Transfer

Change the style or tone of text, for example:

- Rewrite any text in a different style, format (list or paragraphs), or tone.
- Rephrase text.
- Suggest grammatical improvements.

Semantic Similarity

Evaluate several inputs based on how similar their meaning is, for example:

- Evaluate a list of questions sent to a support system to extract the most relevant answer given to similar questions in the past when a new question comes in.
- Replace keyword-based searches with semantic searches to improve search results relevance.

## How OCI Generative AI works

A user’s input can include natural language, input/output examples, and instructions. The LLM analyzes the text input, and can generate, summarize, transform, extract information, or classify text based on the request from the user. A response is sent back to the user in whichever format was specified. This can include raw text or formatting such as bullets and numbering.

In this blog, I configure the OCI Generative AI Service in APEX, set it up for APEX Builder and then test it out with a bonus AI Assistant.

## Instructions

01. Create OCI Credentials in APEX [using this guide](https://mattmulvaney.hashnode.dev/configuration-test-of-oci-credentials-in-apex)

02. In APEX click App Builder > Workspace Utilities > Generative AI Services > Create

03. Complete the screen as follows

    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1723039067322/13a9221f-cc9c-4ab5-b1b1-609415fa0754.png)

04. The **Compartment ID** should be your **Tenancy ID** which you can get from Step 8 of this Guide

05. Select the **Region** as per your **Tenancy Region**. Note: In my case, I choose **Frankfurt**.

06. Click **Save**

07. Go to SQL Workshop > Utilities > UI Defaults > Table Dictionary

08. To enable **specific tables** to be used by AI App Builder, you need to **click on a table** and click **Create Defaults**

09. To enable **all tables** to be used by AI App Builder, click **Synchronize**. [Credit: Plamen](https://x.com/plamen_9/status/1821154028585164811)

10. Optional: Create an AI Assistant in APEX like this

    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1723039687569/5cdeb71d-0336-42e6-b115-5e13bf245183.png)

11. Test it out

    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1723039960042/631c90b6-be11-4ac7-882e-e9bc9d4064d5.png)

    ENJOY!

    What's the picture? A lovely pony in Spofforth. Visit Yorkshire!

In this video, I will share some information
and demo the main capabilities of the Generative

0:05


AI service. The service is now available in
three regions: Frankfurt, London, and Chicago,

0:12


with additional expansion in the works. Using
the playground chat feature, you can quickly

0:17


interact with multiple large language models from
multiple partners. In the chat playground, you can test

0:25


various prompts and receive real-time responses to
evaluate different models for different use cases.

0:38


The large language models can
also generate text. For example,

0:44


we're going to generate a job description for
recruiting based on a list of qualifications.

0:54


Another great use case is text
summarization. In this example,

1:00


we are going to summarize a lengthy blog post into
bullet points, highlighting the important details.

1:16


Style transfers or rewrites are yet another
capability of large language models. Here, we will

1:23


have the model rewrite a set of instructions in a
bullet list format. The service's chat capability

1:31


retains previous conversation information and can
recall it when asked. For instance, we can ask the

1:39


model about item number four without mentioning
what item number four is, and it will understand and respond

1:51


correctly. When satisfied with the result,
generate code to embed in your application.

1:58


The service offers code generation in
Java or Python. Text embeddings allow

2:06


the conversion of text into vectors
for semantic comparison. Two embedding

2:12


models are provided: an English version and
a multi-language version supporting over

2:17


100 languages. In this demonstration, five
sentences will be vectorized and compared

2:24


semantically. The first four sentences describe
departments in an organization, while the last

2:30


sentence talks about coffee. The embedding
model will rank the sentences, showing that

2:37


the first four are semantically closer
to each other than the fifth sentence.

2:47


Dedicated AI clusters provide predictable
performance for large workloads. They allow you

2:54


to allocate dedicated hardware for your specific
use case. You can use these clusters to host a

3:01


pre-trained model or create a custom model based
on a pre-trained one, fine-tuned with your data.

3:09


For unique use cases where the pre-trained
models don't provide the desired results, custom

3:15


models can be created and fine-tuned with your
data. These custom models are based on one of the

3:21


pre-trained models, powered by your dedicated AI
cluster, and augmented with your unique data set.

3:34


Endpoints are network access points that
your application can use to interact

3:38


with pre-trained or custom models
hosted on a dedicated AI cluster.

3:47


One important feature of
endpoints is content moderation,

3:51


which removes toxic and biased
content from model responses.

3:59


Once a custom model is created and
hosted on your dedicated AI cluster,

4:04


you can use it in the playground like any
other pre-trained model. That's it! Thank

4:13


you for watching the OCI Generative
AI Product Tour. For more information,

4:18


please refer to the resources
section of the service overview page.

Authenticate OCI Generative AI Service


## 7.5 Authenticate OCI Generative AI Service

To enable the DB system to access OCI services, perform the
following steps in OCI:


1. [Create\\
    a new dynamic group](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/dynamicgroups/To_create_a_dynamic_group.htm#create-dynamic-group) or
    [update\\
    a dynamic group's matching rules](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/dynamicgroups/To_update_a_dynamic_groups_matching_rules.htm), and the following
    matching rule to include all MySQL HeatWave DB systems in the defined
    compartment:




```terminal
Press CTRL+C to copy


ALL{resource.type = 'mysqldbsystem', resource.compartment.id = 'ocid1.compartment.oc1..AlphanumericString'}
```

2. [Add\\
    policies for the dynamic group](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/callresources/Writing_Policies_for_Dynamic_Groups.htm) that grant the dynamic
    group access to the target service's APIs:




```terminal
Press CTRL+C to copy


allow dynamic-group IdentityDomainName/GroupName to use generative-ai-chat in compartment CompartmentName
allow dynamic-group IdentityDomainName/GroupName to use generative-ai-text-embedding in compartment CompartmentName
allow dynamic-group IdentityDomainName/GroupName to inspect generative-ai-model in compartment CompartmentName
```




    Replace the following:




   - _`IdentityDomainName`_: the
      identity domain name.




     Note




     If the dynamic group belongs to the default identity
     domain, you can omit specifying the identity domain
     name.


   - _`GroupName`_: the dynamic group
      name


   - _`CompartmentID`_: the compartment
      ID of the DB system



For more information, see
[Resource\\
Principals](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/mysql-database/doc/resource-principals.html).


In addition, for resource principal authentication, MySQL HeatWave
automatically sets the
[`rapid_ml_genai`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/heatwave/en/heatwave-system-variables.html#sysvar_rapid_ml_genai) system variable.
The default value of the variable is the compartment ID of the DB
system you are using.


To use a different compartment for accessing the OCI Generative AI
service, you can set the
[`rapid_ml_genai_session`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/heatwave/en/heatwave-system-variables.html#sysvar_rapid_ml_genai_session) system
variable to specify the ID of the compartment you want to use, as
shown below:


```terminal
Press CTRL+C to copy


SET rapid_ml_genai_session = '{"compartment_id": "ocid1.compartment.oc1..AlphanumericString"}';
```

The compartment ID specified in the
[`rapid_ml_genai_session`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/heatwave/en/heatwave-system-variables.html#sysvar_rapid_ml_genai_session) system
variable must match the compartment ID you used to create the
dynamic group and add the OCI Generative AI Service authentication
policy.

# Next Steps: Demo

ORACLE
## Introduction

This article aims to provide a comprehensive guide for beginners to get started with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Generative AI service. This article covers everything from creating an account to setting up the environment and running the first AI task using Python, starting with a brief overview of the main features.

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is one of the big cloud platforms currently available in the market together with AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. Among the others, OCI offers several AI services, from the GPU infrastructure to AI-based services such as a powerful platform for creating and deploying GenAI-powered apps. OCI Generative AI provides a collection of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) specialized for various tasks, including text generation, summarization, and text embeddings. These models can be fine-tuned with custom datasets and deployed on a dedicated AI cluster. Also, content moderation and controls are available to model endpoints. Currently, available models include the Meta Llama series and Cohere's Command R and R+, accessible through the OCI SDK (supporting Python, Java, and Node.js), OCI CLI, and the Chat Playground. Additionally, the OCI SDK is integrated with popular open-source frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex.

## Getting started with OCI Generative AI

Before getting hands-on with the code, there are several preliminary steps to follow to set up the required resources on OCI.

1\. **Creating an Account**: visit the [Oracle Cloud website](https://www.oracle.com/it/cloud/sign-in.html) and sign up for an account. You'll need to provide some basic information and verify your email address. Once your account is created, you can access the OCI Console. A free trial is available for new users, which includes some credits to experiment with the services.

2\. **Navigating the OCI Console**: The OCI Console is your main interface for managing cloud resources. Familiarize yourself with the dashboard, where you can access various services, monitor usage, and configure settings. Specifically, the playground allows us to experiment with the models hosted on OCI easily. To access the playground, navigate to _Generative AI > Playground > Chat_ and select the model you want to use. An example of the [OCI Generative AI Playground](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/) is shown below (Figure 1).

3\. **Generating an API key**: After creating your account, you'll need to create an API key that is mandatory for authentication with the OCI Generative AI service. To create an API key:

- Go to your profile settings, find _Resources > API keys_ and click on the _Add Public Key_ button.
- Then, check on _Generate API key pair_ and download the private and public key files ( _e.g.,_ default `~/.oci` directory).
- When finished, click on the _Add_ button.

The last step is to create a configuration file that contains the necessary information to authenticate with the OCI services. An example of the configuration file is prompted after the API key creation. As suggested, store the configuration file in the default location `~/.oci/config`. Be sure to set the correct path of the previously downloaded private key in the configuration file.

For example:

```
[DEFAULT]
user=<your-oci-user-ocid>  # TODO
fingerprint=<your-fingerprint>  # TODO
tenancy=<your-tenancy-ocid>  # TODO
region=eu-frankfurt-1  # Frankfurt EU region
key_file=/home/sammy/.oci/my-private-key.pem  # TODO: Full path to the private key
```

4\. **Create a Compartment**: Compartments are logical containers that help you organize and control access to your cloud resources. You can create a new compartment from the OCI Console by navigating to _Identity > Compartments_ and clicking on _Create Compartment_.

## Setting up the environment

Before running your first AI task, you need to set up the environment by installing the necessary libraries and dependencies. The requirement is to have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine, since in this article we use Python to interact with the OCI Generative AI service.

Next, you must set up a virtual environment to manage the dependencies of your project. You can use `venv` or `conda` to create a virtual environment. Here's how to create a virtual environment using `conda`:

1\. Install `miniconda` by following the instructions [here](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install#quickstart-install-instructions).

2\. Create and activate a new conda environment:

```
conda create --name oci-genai python=3.11
conda activate oci-genai
```

3\. Install the [`oci-python-sdk`](https://github.com/oracle/oci-python-sdk) library using `pip` :

```
pip install oci
```

Enter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode

## Running the first AI task

Now that the setup is complete, we can run our first task using the OCI Generative AI service. In the following examples, we use the `oci-python-sdk` library to interact with the model inference endpoints.

An interesting feature of OCI Generative AI that we will cover is the `seed` parameter, recently introduced in the API, which forces the model backend to generate deterministic responses from the model for the same input. However, it is not fully guaranteed but can be useful for debugging and testing purposes.

Create a new Python script called `main.py` and use the snippets below to run your first AI task. To execute, run `python main.py` in your terminal after activating the virtual environment.

### 1\. Setup the authentication and OCI Generative AI client

The authentication is handled by the OCI SDK, which reads the configuration file from the default location `~/.oci/config`:

```
import oci
from oci.generative_ai_inference import GenerativeAiInferenceClient
from oci.retry import NoneRetryStrategy

# Read DEFAULT profile from OCI config
config = oci.config.from_file("~/.oci/config", "DEFAULT")
# Validate the config file
oci.config.validate_config(config)

# OCI configuration
OCI_COMPARTMENT_ID = "your.oci.compartment.ocid"  # TODO: Set your compartment OCID
OCI_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT = "https://inference.generativeai.eu-frankfurt-1.oci.oraclecloud.com"  # EU Frankfurt region
SEED = 123  # Seed parameter for the current chat session

# Create the Inference client
genai_client = GenerativeAiInferenceClient(
    config=config,
    service_endpoint=OCI_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT,
    retry_strategy=NoneRetryStrategy(),  # Set a retry strategy
    timeout=(10, 240)  # Connect and read timeout
)
```

### 2\. Example for Meta Llama models hosted on OCI

The OCI SDK provides two distinct implementations for the available chat models, one for the Llama models and one for the Cohere models. The complete list of available models can be found in the [OCI Generative AI documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/pretrained-models.htm). The Llama models are implemented using the `GenericChatRequest` and the following example demonstrates how to use them.

```
from oci.generative_ai_inference.models import (
    ChatDetails,
    GenericChatRequest,
    SystemMessage,
    AssistantMessage,
    UserMessage,
    TextContent,
    OnDemandServingMode
)

# Specify the OCI model ID
OCI_MODEL_ID = "meta.llama-3.3-70b-instruct"

# Define the chat conversation
# The conversation starts with the system message and then the user message
# Supported roles: SYSTEM, USER, ASSISTANT
messages = [\
    SystemMessage(content=[TextContent(text="Sei un menestrello del medioevo che racconta storie ai viaggiatori")]),\
    UserMessage(content=[TextContent(text="Raccontami una breve storia")])\
    # Add more chat history if needed\
    # AssistantMessage(content=[TextContent(text="C'era una volta...")]),\
    # UserMessage(content=[TextContent(text="E poi?")]),\
]

# Compose the chat request
chat_request = GenericChatRequest(
    seed=SEED,  # Forces the model to generate a deterministic response, but not fully guaranteed
    api_format="GENERIC",
    messages=messages,
    max_tokens=1000,  # Limit response length
    temperature=0.7  # Controls the creativity of the model. Lower values mean less creative
)

# Compose the chat request details
chat_detail = ChatDetails(
    serving_mode=OnDemandServingMode(model_id=OCI_MODEL_ID),
    chat_request=chat_request,
    compartment_id=OCI_COMPARTMENT_ID
)

chat_response = genai_client.chat(chat_detail)

# Print result
response_text = chat_response.data.chat_response.choices[0].message.content[0].text

print("************************** Chat Result **************************\n")
print(response_text)
```

 **La Leggenda del Cavaliere della Luna**

Oh, ascoltate, viaggiatori, e lasciate che le mie parole vi trasportino in un'epoca di antica magia e valorosi cavalieri. La storia che sto per raccontarvi è quella di un cavaliere coraggioso, noto come il Cavaliere della Luna.

In una terra lontana, dove le stelle brillavano con intensità e la luna piena illuminava le notti, viveva un cavaliere di nome Sir Edward. Era un guerriero leale e onesto, amato dal suo popolo e rispettato dai suoi pari. Sir Edward possedeva un dono unico: poteva comunicare con gli animali della foresta, e in particolare con un grande cavallo bianco, noto come Alba.

Una notte, mentre la luna era alta nel cielo, Sir Edward ricevette una visione misteriosa. Una voce gli sussurrò all'orecchio di recarsi al castello abbandonato di Malakai, dove una principessa era stata imprigionata da un dragone crudele. Il cavaliere, senza esitare, sellò Alba e partì verso il castello.

Durante il viaggio, incontrarono molte difficoltà e pericoli, ma Sir Edward e Alba superarono ogni ostacolo con coraggio e astuzia. Quando finalmente raggiunsero il castello, trovarono la principessa imprigionata in una torre alta e il dragone che la sorvegliava.

Sir Edward, con la sua spada in mano, sfidò il dragone e lo sconfisse in un duello epico. La principessa fu liberata e ringraziò il cavaliere per il suo coraggio. Da quel giorno, Sir Edward divenne noto come il Cavaliere della Luna, e la sua leggenda si diffuse in tutta la terra.

E così, viaggiatori, la storia del Cavaliere della Luna ci ricorda che il coraggio e la lealtà possono superare anche gli ostacoli più grandi, e che la magia della luna può guidarci verso la vittoria e la gloria.

**Fine della storia**

Spero che vi sia piaciuta, viaggiatori! Se desiderate ascoltare altre storie, sono qui per raccontarvele.

### 3\. Example for Cohere Command models hosted on OCI

On the other hand, the Cohere models are implemented using the `CohereChatRequest` and `CohereSystemMessage` classes. The following example demonstrates how to use the Cohere models from Cohere hosted on OCI.

```
from oci.generative_ai_inference.models import (
    ChatDetails,
    CohereChatRequest,
    CohereSystemMessage,
    OnDemandServingMode
)

# Specify the OCI model ID
OCI_MODEL_ID = "cohere.command-r-08-2024"  # or cohere.command-r-plus-08-2024

# Add chat history
chat_history = [\
    CohereSystemMessage(message="Sei un menestrello del medioevo che racconta storie ai viaggiatori")\
    # Add more chat history if needed\
    # CohereUserMessage(message="Raccontami una breve storia")\
    # CohereChatBotMessage(message="C'era una volta...")\
]
# Define the input message
user_message = "Raccontami una breve storia"

# Compose the chat request
chat_request = CohereChatRequest(
    seed=SEED,  # Forces the model to generate a deterministic response, but not fully guaranteed
    chat_history=chat_history,
    message=user_message,
    max_tokens=1000,  # Limit response length
    temperature=0.7  # Controls the creativity of the model. Lower values mean less creative
)

# Compose the chat request details
chat_detail = ChatDetails(
    serving_mode=OnDemandServingMode(model_id=OCI_MODEL_ID),
    chat_request=chat_request,
    compartment_id=OCI_COMPARTMENT_ID
)

chat_response = genai_client.chat(chat_detail)

# Print result
response_text = chat_response.data.chat_response.chat_history[-1].message

print("************************** Chat Result **************************\n")
print(response_text)
```

Enter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode

An output of the above code snippet is the following:

```
************************** Chat Result **************************

Incamminatevi, o viandanti, e prestate orecchio a questa storia che vi narrerò. Era una fredda notte d'inverno, quando un valoroso cavaliere, di nome Corvo, si trovò ad affrontare una terribile tempesta di neve. Il vento ululava e la visibilità era quasi nulla, ma il nostro eroe non si lasciò scoraggiare.

Corvo, con il suo fedele destriero, cavalcava senza sosta, cercando rifugio in quel gelido paesaggio. Ad un tratto, scorse una luce tremolante in lontananza, come un barlume di speranza. Si diresse verso quella direzione, guidando il suo cavallo attraverso la bufera.

Arrivato a destinazione, trovò un'antica locanda, avvolta dal mistero. La porta si aprì con un cigolio, rivelando un caldo focolare e un'accogliente atmosfera. Il locandiere, un uomo saggio e burbero, offrì a Corvo un pasto caldo e un riparo per la notte.

Mentre il cavaliere riposava, sognò di un'avventura che lo attendeva. Una misteriosa principessa era stata rapita da un drago malvagio, e solo lui poteva salvarla. Armato di coraggio e della sua fidata spada, Corvo si preparò ad affrontare il mostro.

Il giorno seguente, il nostro eroe partì alla ricerca del drago. Attraversò foreste oscure e montagne impervie, affrontando pericoli e insidie. Finalmente, raggiunse la tana del drago, un luogo tenebroso e pieno di tesori rubati.

Con un'ultima carica coraggiosa, Corvo affrontò il drago in un duello epico. La sua spada scintillava sotto i raggi del sole, mentre il drago sputava fuoco e terrore. Ma la determinazione del cavaliere ebbe la meglio, e alla fine riuscì a sconfiggere la creatura.

Liberando la principessa, Corvo divenne un eroe leggendario. La sua storia si diffuse in tutto il regno, e il suo nome fu cantato dai menestrelli per generazioni. E così, o cari viandanti, vi lascio con questa avventura, ricordandovi che il coraggio e la determinazione possono superare qualsiasi tempesta.

E ora, vi lascio con una canzone che celebra le gesta di Corvo, il cavaliere coraggioso!
