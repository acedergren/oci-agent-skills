- [Removing a Filter Tag from a Rule](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Events/Task/remove-filter-tag-events-rule.htm "Remove a filter tag from a rule.")


## Prerequisites for Creating Rules 🔗

- Action resources: You must have resources already set up to specify as an action. The Events service invokes the action specified in the rule by delivering the event message to action resources, which can include **topics**, streams, or functions. Every rule must have at least one action. The Events service can invoke any of the following services by delivering an event message for processing:




- IAM policies: To manage or list rules, you must be given the required type of access in a **policy** written by an administrator, whether you're using the Console or the REST API with an SDK, CLI, or other tool. If you try to perform a task and get a message that you don't have permission or are unauthorized, confirm with your administrator the type of access you have been granted and which **compartment** you should work in. For more information, see [Events and IAM Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Events/Concepts/eventspolicy.htm "Write policies for the Events service, including authorizations for non-administrator users and the Events service itself.").

- Event messages: To create rules, the resources you want to monitor with the rule must emit events. For more information, see [Services that Produce Events](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Events/Reference/eventsproducers.htm "Review the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services that emit events.").

## Working with Rules 🔗

**Note**

Each rule can have a maximum of 10 actions.

A typical workflow for setting up rule might follow this pattern:

1. **Identify action resources**
Set up or identify whatever action resources you intend to use with the rule. For example, you might set up a Notifications topic and create subscriptions for the DevOps team so that they are notified when backups complete. If a topic already exists, you can use it instead of creating a topic. The resources you specify for actions do not have to be in the same compartment as the rule.

2. **Plan filtering**
Ensure the resources that you want to monitor emit events to the Events service and plan your pattern matching strategy. For example, you might want to monitor backups on Autonomous AI Lakehouse instances in the ABC compartment. Ensure Autonomous AI Lakehouse instances emit an event type you can use to create the automation you require. Review the example JSON event to determine the best way to identify those resources in filters. See [Matching Events with Filters](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Events/Concepts/filterevents.htm "Match events with pattern filters in rules to build automation.") and [Services that Produce Events](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Events/Reference/eventsproducers.htm "Review the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services that emit events.").

3. **Create the rule**
Rules apply to events in the compartment in which you create them and any child compartments. Create a rule in the compartment with the resource you want to monitor and specify where to deliver matching events. For example, in the ABC compartment, you might create a rule that filters for Autonomous AI Lakehouse backup events. Since Events has no requirement about the location of action resources, you could specify a topic in the XYZ compartment as the resource to deliver any matching events.


## Managing Tags for Rules 🔗

You can apply tags to resources to help you organize them according to business needs. You can apply tags at the time you create a resource, or you can update the resource later with tags. For general information about applying tags, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).

### Tags and Event Filtering 🔗

With Events, you can also use tags to target resources in your tenancy. You target resources by adding the tag to a filter in a rule. A _filter tag_ helps you hone automation by targeting only resources that contain a particular tag. For example, let's say you have dozens of Database instances in your tenancy, but only a few of the most critical of these instances have the tag "Operations." You could create a rule that triggers a particular action for resources that only contain the "Operations" tag.

Policy for working with filter tags is no different from policy for working with tags.

[To manage filter tags](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Events/Task/managingrules.htm#)

1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Observability & Management**. Under **Events Service**, select **Rules**.

2. Choose a **Compartment** you have permission to work in, and then click rule's name.
3. In the **Resources** menu, click **Event Matching**.
4. In the **Filter Tags** section, you can view or edit existing filter tags, or click **Add Filter Tag** to add new ones.

### Managing Tags for Rules 🔗

1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Observability & Management**. Under **Events Service**, select **Rules**.

2. Select the **Compartment** from the list.

All events rules in that compartment are listed in tabular form.

3. Select the events rule whose tags you want to manage.

The Rules Details page appears.

4. Click the **Tags** tab to view or edit existing tags, or click **Add Tags** to add new ones.

For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).

## Move Rules to a Different Compartment 🔗

You can move rules from one compartment to another. When you move a rule to a new compartment, you stop monitoring events from resources in the current compartment and begin monitoring events in the new compartment (and any child compartments). After you move the rule to the new compartment, inherent policies apply immediately and affect access to the rules through the Console. Moving rules doesn't affect access by the Events service to actions defined in rules. For more information, see [Managing Compartments](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/compartments/managingcompartments.htm).

## Monitoring Rules 🔗

You can monitor the health, capacity, and performance of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources by using metrics, alarms, and notifications. For more information, see [Monitoring](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/home.htm) and [Notifications](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Notification/home.htm).

For more information about monitoring the rules you create, see [Events Metrics](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Events/Reference/eventsmetrics.htm "Understand the metrics emitted by the metric namespace oci_cloudevents (the Events service).").

## Object Events and the Events Service 🔗

Events for objects are handled differently than other resources. Objects don't emit events by default. Use the Console, CLI, or API to enable a bucket to emit events for object state changes. You can enable events for object state changes during or after bucket creation. See [Enabling or Disabling Emitting Events for Object State Changes](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/managingbuckets_topic-To_enable_or_disable_emitting_events_for_object_state_changes.htm) for more information.

# Creating an Events Rule

Create a rule in Events to create automation based on the state changes of resources throughout your tenancy.

- [Console](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Events/Task/create-events-rule.htm#)
- [CLI](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Events/Task/create-events-rule.htm#)
- [API](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Events/Task/create-events-rule.htm#)

- 01. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Observability & Management**. Under **Events Service**, select **Rules**.

02. Under **List Scope**, select a compartment you have permission to work in.


      Events compares the rules you create in this compartment to event messages emitted from resources in this compartment and any child compartments.

03. Click **Create Rule**.

04. In the **Create Rule** panel, provide a friendly name for the rule and a description of what the rule does. You can change both values later. Avoid entering confidential information.


      In the **Rule Conditions** area, you can define filters based on event types, attributes, and tags to limit the events that trigger actions. See [Matching Events with Filters](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Events/Concepts/filterevents.htm "Match events with pattern filters in rules to build automation."). Complete the following steps to define these filters.

      **Tip**



       To match all events, leave this field blank. Skip to step 8.

05. To filter events by add an event type, follow these steps.
      1. For **Condition**, select **Event Type**.
      2. Select a service.
      3. In **Event Type**, select one or more types of events for this the service.
      4. To add event types for a different service, click **\+ Another Condition** and select **Event Type** repeat the preceding steps to add event types for a different service.
06. To further filter event types by using attributes, follow these steps. You must create an event type condition before you can add an attribute.
      1. After adding an event type, click **+ Another Condition**.
      2. For **Condition**, select **Attribute**.
      3. Select an attribute.
      4. (Optional) In **Attribute Values**, select or enter values for the attribute.
07. To filter events by using tags, follow these steps.





      Filter tags help you to hone automation by targeting only resources that contain a particular tag. If you want to use tags to organize your rules, use resource tags instead. For more information, see [Managing Tags for Rules](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Events/Task/managingrules.htm#Tags).







      1. For **Condition**, select **Filter Tag**
      2. Select a tag namespace.
         To specify a free-form tag, select **None (add a free-form tag)**.

      3. Select a tag key.
      4. (Optional) Enter a tag value.
      5. To add another tag, click **+ Another Condition** and repeat the preceding steps.

08. To validate the rule based on the conditions that you specified, click **Validate Rule** and follow these steps in the **Validate Rule** panel.

      You can evaluate a rule against one event type at a time. To test different event types, repeat these steps as necessary.
      1. In **Service Name**, select a service.

# Empowering OCI IAM – Seamless Event-Based Integration via OCI Events Service (Part 1)

March 28, 20244 minute read

![Profile picture of GK (Gopi Krishna) Goalla](http://blogs.oracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gk.jpg)[GK (Gopi Krishna) Goalla](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/authors/gkgoalla)
Master Cloud Architect - Security @ OCI

Connecting and sharing data across diverse systems is crucial in modern software development. Almost every application requires communication and data exchange with various services, both internally and externally. This is where an event-driven integration becomes particularly useful. An event-driven integration allows you to share information about events (a.k.a state change) which occur in your systems, and downstream applications listen to those events and update their state accordingly if necessary. This approach allows decoupled systems in a distributed architecture to easily communicate and work with each other effectively.

This idea can be leveraged and applied in handling changes to your IAM (Identity & Access Management) resources, such as users or groups, as well. If you’ve been in the identity management space for a while, you’ve probably encountered the concept of “ **IAM events**.” If not, no worries—let’s start with the basics.

A change to a IAM resource is referred to as  an “ **IAM event**“.  Here are few common examples:

- User creation (New Joinee)
- Group creation
- Change in user’s department (Job transfer)
- Disabling an user account (Termination)
- Locking an user account (due to certain no.of wrong password attempts)
- Adding an user to a group (Granting additional access)
- User’s API key creation

As a result of a specific IAM event, you may wish to trigger an action. This action could involve either notifying downstream applications about the event or executing a specific function/code to accomplish a particular task. For example, you may wish to notify a system administrator when a new employee joins the company, or invoke an access review when an employee’s role changes.

## **Event Driven Integration with OCI IAM (Identity & Access Management)**

Based on my recent discussions with several Oracle Cloud customers about their needs related to integrating OCI IAM events with their applications, I found it valuable to put something together on this topic.This blog post provides you high level details for implementing **OCI IAM** events based integration by utilizing **OCI Events servcie**.

_OCI IAM service_ is critical for managing security and ensuring proper access controls in your Oracle cloud tenancy, as well as in applications within the organization.

_OCI Events Service_ monitors changes to resources (e.g., user identities) through events, allowing developers to automatically respond to changes in real-time by triggering code execution, writing to streaming service, or sending alerts using Notifications.

OCI IAM service emits events whenever there’s a change to IAM resources mentioned below (it’s more than just user identities).

- User
- Group
- IAM Policy
- API Key
- Auth Token
- Other resources.

Here is a sample list of possible state changes, per IAM resource type, for which events are emitted.

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **User** | **Group** | **IAM Policy** | **API Key** | **Auth Token** |
| - Create<br>- Update<br>- Delete<br>- Activate<br>- Deactivate<br>- User Capabilities Update | - Create<br>- Update<br>- Delete<br>- Add User To<br>- Remove User From | - Create<br>- Update<br>- Delete | - Upload<br>- Delete | - Create<br>- Update<br>- Delete |

To capture an event as soon it’s generated, you need have an _**event rule**_ in place that allows you take an appropriate action. Here are high level steps to do this.

- Create an event rule using OCI Events Service. Select _Event Type_, _Service Name_ and _Event Type_ as per your need.

![1event](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/134/2025/11/1-6.jpg)

- Configure appropriate action that drives how you would like to process the generated event.

![2event](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/134/2025/11/2-4.jpg)

As shown in the above picture, action type could be one of below types.

- Streaming
- Notifications
- Functions

**Streaming:** This action type allows you to push IAM event information to a Kafka-based OCI stream. Once the information is available in the stream, it can be either pushed to or pulled by your downstream applications, such as a SIEM system.

**Notification:** This action type allows you to notify IAM event details to a required party (human or a subscripton endpoint) through supported channels mentioned below.

- Email
- SMS
- Slack
- PagerDuty
- HTTPS Custom Endpoint

**Functions:** This action type allows you to trigger a code execution to carry out a specific job in your downstream applications. This option is more suited for your custom use cases.

**Note:** While action types “Streaming” and “Notifications” are essentially “ _Fire and Forget_” methods (unidirectional), the “Function” action type (bi-directional) allows you to execute your code/script to take action in downstream applications, receive responses from those applications, and, if necessary, updates your IAM resource based on the response.

When OCI IAM emits an event that matches the condition specified in the event rule, the event will be intercepted, and the corresponding action type will be triggered. Each event’s information is emitted in the form of a JSON payload. For example, for the “create user” operation, the IAM service emits an event as shown below.

![3event](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/134/2025/11/3-4.jpg)

## **Conclusion:**

Integrating IAM events with your downstream applications using the OCI IAM and Events services offers a robust and efficient way to manage and respond to changes in real-time. By leveraging event-driven integration, organizations can enhance their security posture, streamline workflows, and ensure seamless communication between decoupled systems. This approach not only improves operational efficiency but also provides the flexibility to adapt to evolving business needs and technological advancements. Implementing these integrations can ultimately lead to more resilient and responsive identity management systems.

In this blog post, Part 1, we explored what IAM events-based integration is and Oracle’s approach to addressing this use case. In the next installment of this series, you will dive into a hands-on approach with a practical use case. Stay tuned!

## Rule Resource Properties [Anchor](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/oci/api-docs/events/rule/\#properties)

To learn more about resource properties and how to use them, see [Inputs and Outputs](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/inputs-outputs) in the Architecture and Concepts docs.

### Inputs [Anchor](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/oci/api-docs/events/rule/\#inputs)

In Python, inputs that are objects can be passed either as [argument classes or as dictionary literals](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/languages-sdks/python/#inputs-and-outputs).

The Rule resource accepts the following [input](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/inputs-outputs) properties:

[Actions](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/oci/api-docs/events/rule/#actions_csharp)This property is required.[RuleActions](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/oci/api-docs/events/rule/#ruleactions)(Updatable) A list of ActionDetails objects to create for a rule.[CompartmentId](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/oci/api-docs/events/rule/#compartmentid_csharp)This property is required.string(Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment to which this rule belongs.[Condition](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/oci/api-docs/events/rule/#condition_csharp)This property is required.string

(Updatable) A filter that specifies the event that will trigger actions associated with this rule. A few important things to remember about filters:

- Fields not mentioned in the condition are ignored. You can create a valid filter that matches all events with two curly brackets: `{}`

For more examples, see [Matching Events with Filters](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Concepts/filterevents.htm).

- For a condition with fields to match an event, the event must contain all the field names listed in the condition. Field names must appear in the condition with the same nesting structure used in the event.

For a list of reference events, see [Services that Produce Events](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Reference/eventsproducers.htm).

- Rules apply to events in the compartment in which you create them and any child compartments. This means that a condition specified by a rule only matches events emitted from resources in the compartment or any of its child compartments.
- Wildcard matching is supported with the asterisk (\*) character.

For examples of wildcard matching, see [Matching Events with Filters](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Concepts/filterevents.htm)

Example: `\"eventType\": \"com.oraclecloud.databaseservice.autonomous.database.backup.end\"`

[DisplayName](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/oci/api-docs/events/rule/#displayname_csharp)This property is required.string(Updatable) A string that describes the rule. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.[IsEnabled](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/oci/api-docs/events/rule/#isenabled_csharp)This property is required.bool

(Updatable) Whether or not this rule is currently enabled. Example: `true`

\\*\\* IMPORTANT \*\*
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values

It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.[FreeformTags](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/oci/api-docs/events/rule/#freeformtags_csharp)Dictionary<string, string>(Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. Exists for cross-compatibility only.

(Updatable) A filter that specifies the event that will trigger actions associated with this rule. A few important things to remember about filters:

- Fields not mentioned in the condition are ignored. You can create a valid filter that matches all events with two curly brackets: `{}`

For more examples, see [Matching Events with Filters](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Concepts/filterevents.htm).

- For a condition with fields to match an event, the event must contain all the field names listed in the condition. Field names must appear in the condition with the same nesting structure used in the event.

For a list of reference events, see [Services that Produce Events](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Reference/eventsproducers.htm).

- Rules apply to events in the compartment in which you create them and any child compartments. This means that a condition specified by a rule only matches events emitted from resources in the compartment or any of its child compartments.
- Wildcard matching is supported with the asterisk (\*) character.

For examples of wildcard matching, see [Matching Events with Filters](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Concepts/filterevents.htm)

[lifecycle\_message](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/oci/api-docs/events/rule/#state_lifecycle_message_python)strA message generated by the Events service about the current state of this rule.[state](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/oci/api-docs/events/rule/#state_state_python)strThe current state of the rule.[time\_created](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/oci/api-docs/events/rule/#state_time_created_python)strThe time this rule was created, expressed in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) timestamp format. Example: `2018-09-12T22:47:12.613Z`

[actions](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/oci/api-docs/events/rule/#state_actions_yaml)[Property Map](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/oci/api-docs/events/rule/#ruleactions)(Updatable) A list of ActionDetails objects to create for a rule.[compartmentId](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/oci/api-docs/events/rule/#state_compartmentid_yaml)String(Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment to which this rule belongs.[condition](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/oci/api-docs/events/rule/#state_condition_yaml)String

(Updatable) A filter that specifies the event that will trigger actions associated with this rule. A few important things to remember about filters:

- Fields not mentioned in the condition are ignored. You can create a valid filter that matches all events with two curly brackets: `{}`

For more examples, see [Matching Events with Filters](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Concepts/filterevents.htm).

- For a condition with fields to match an event, the event must contain all the field names listed in the condition. Field names must appear in the condition with the same nesting structure used in the event.

For a list of reference events, see [Services that Produce Events](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Reference/eventsproducers.htm).

- Rules apply to events in the compartment in which you create them and any child compartments. This means that a condition specified by a rule only matches events emitted from resources in the compartment or any of its child compartments.
- Wildcard matching is supported with the asterisk (\*) character.

For examples of wildcard matching, see [Matching Events with Filters](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Concepts/filterevents.htm)

Example: `\"eventType\": \"com.oraclecloud.databaseservice.autonomous.database.backup.end\"`

I was playing lately with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Events Service and Functions and while searching through resources already available, I stumbled upon [this great video about OCI Functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwlWOxjPUnM&list=PLKCk3OyNwIztTYCg2qkXDHOOfdw6OeDU3&index=4&t=0s) and I thought that it would be nice to actually create the demo presented in that video.

The demo use case sounds something like this:

_When a new Compute instance is provisioned or terminated, an OCI Event rule will call an OCI Function that will create or delete a new Object Storage Bucket with the name of the instance in the same compartment._

Let’s build this.

## Setup Dynamic-Group & Policies

Before going into Events, Functions, and Python, we should set up the environment first.

### Create a Dynamic-Group for OCI Functions

I have a dynamic-group that I use for both my Fn development environment (which is on an OCI Compute instance) and for giving rights to my Functions in OCI.

[Check this post if you want to see how to set up your development environment for OCI Functions.](https://mytechretreat.com/setup-development-environment-for-oci-functions/)

Under _Identity — Dynamic Groups_ click on Create Dynamic Group:

Press enter or click to view image in full size

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*JWoEyb_yoPzn8-MO.png)

There are two rules here:

1. The first rule is for my development environment — so the instance from where I deploy my Functions has access. I specify the **Instance ID** but also the **Compartment ID** if I want to use another instance from the same compartment
2. The second rule is for the Functions. I specify the resource type **fnfunc** and **the compartment** where I will deploy the Function

### Create Policies

Under _Identity — Policies_ click on _Create Policy:_

Press enter or click to view image in full size

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*v0CKRNhz2FGAGpxA.png)

_Statement 1_ — Will give access to Function as a Service to read the docker repositories in my tenancy

_Statement 2_ — Will give access to Function as a Service to access network resources in my compartment

_Statement 3_ — Will give access to my Fn Development Instance and my deployed Functions to manage all resources in my compartment. Of course, you can fine grain the policies depending on your use case.

Make sure you also have the right policies for the FaaS — [check this page to create the policy you need.](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Functions/Tasks/functionscreatingpolicies.htm)

## Create a new Application

Under _Developer Services — Functions_ click on _Create Application:_

Press enter or click to view image in full size

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*SN5hOKo_AP9gYaLj.png)

I have deployed my app in a public subnet, inside my VCN and I will send the logs to my papertrail account — I like to use papertrail for logging, especially in a development phase of my apps.

### Create Function

From your development environment, create a new python function — I am doing this from my OCI Compute instance:

```
ubuntu@fn-dev:~$ fn init --runtime python create-bucket-for-compute
Creating function at: ./create-bucket-for-compute
Function boilerplate generated.
func.yaml created.
```

The newly created function should look like this:

```
ubuntu@fn-dev:~$ cd create-bucket-for-compute/
ubuntu@fn-dev:~/create-bucket-for-compute$ ll
total 20
drwxr-xr-x 2 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Apr 18 16:34 ./
drwxr-xr-x 10 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Apr 18 16:34 ../
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 574 Apr 18 16:34 func.py
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 154 Apr 18 16:34 func.yaml
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 3 Apr 18 16:34 requirements.txt
```

### Deploy & Test

We’ll just deploy and test the hello-world function for now and we’ll come back a bit later on this to actually write the code that will create or delete a bucket based on a Compute event.

From inside the function folder, deploy to the application created from the OCI Console — mine was **create-bucket-app.**

```
ubuntu@fn-dev:~/create-bucket-for-compute$ fn -v deploy --app create-bucket-app
```

Let’s try to invoke the function to see that it works:

```
ubuntu@fn-dev:~/create-bucket-for-compute$ fn invoke create-bucket-app create-bucket-for-compute
{"message": "Hello World"}
```

Great — now that this works, we should set up the event first and then write the complete function based on the CloudEvent.

## Create Event Rule

Let’s create an event that will trigger the whole process.

Under _Application Integration — Events Services_ click on _Create Rule:_

Press enter or click to view image in full size

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*KRbXbyAB_BKgJaiR.png)

I am choosing to trigger this event when:

- A new instance is created — **Instance — Lanch End**
- An instance is terminated — **Instance — Terminate End**
- I want only to trigger the event only for instances inside my compartment — **Ionut**

The Action is to trigger the function — **create-bucket-for-compute**— that we just deployed earlier.

## The python function

Now, let’s head back to the development environment and let’s write the actual script that will do all the work.

I will be using the [OCI Python SDK](https://oracle-cloud-infrastructure-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to create and delete the buckets, so I have to add it to the **requirements.txt** so it will be installed on the docker container that will hold the function:

```
ubuntu@fn-dev:~/create-bucket-for-compute$ cat requirements.txt
fdk
oci==2.12.4
```

This is the latest stable version at the time of the article.

### Authentication

To execute API calls against OCI, you have to authenticate. I will use Instance Principals signer for that. [You can read more about that in this article.](https://mytechretreat.com/use-instance-principals-with-oci-python-sdk/)

### Read the Cloud Event

When called by the event service, a [Cloud Event](https://cloudevents.io/) type of message will be sent and you can read it like this:

### Get the event type

We will use the same function for both create and delete, so we’d have to know whether the instance was created or deleted:

[You can find all the event types in here.](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Events/Reference/eventsproducers.htm)

### Initiate the Object Storage Client

We will initiate the Object Storage Client so we can create and/or delete Object Storage Buckets:

We pass the signer for authentication purposes. [You can find out more about how to use the OCI Python SDK here.](https://mytechretreat.com/how-to-use-the-oci-python-sdk-to-make-api-calls/)

### Create Bucket

We will create a bucket in the same compartment as the instance and with the same name as the instance:

The compartment id and the resource name will come from the Cloud Event.

### Delete Bucket

To delete a bucket, you need the namespace and its name:

## Complete solution

Let’s put everything together in the function:

and deploy it:

```
ubuntu@fn-dev:~/create-bucket-for-compute$ fn -v deploy --app create-bucket-app
```

## Test the solution

All that’s left now is to test the solution.

First of all, let’s create a new Compute instance in our compartment and wait for it to be provisioned:

Press enter or click to view image in full size

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*e7TOpC7Vww5Hy4tF.png)

Once it was provisioned — the Event Rule created earlier will be triggered (you can check the logs under _Application Integration — Events Service — Your Rule — Logs)_ and that will call our Function.

The Function will create, in the same compartment, a bucket with the same name as the instance:

Press enter or click to view image in full size

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*NuQXjOQ7I0unvYVo.png)

Now, terminate the instance and the bucket will be automatically deleted.

## Conclusions

The combination of OCI Events and OCI Functions can be really useful when trying to automate your tasks or when trying to build Infrastructure as Code.

# Event Rule

An Event Rule in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is used to detect specific events within your tenancy and trigger automated actions in response. It listens for events from OCI services, such as resource changes or lifecycle state updates, and routes them to defined targets like Functions, Notifications, or Streaming. This enables event-driven automation, allowing you to respond quickly to changes without manual intervention. Event Rules help streamline operations, enforce governance, and integrate OCI services with external systems.

```fallback
oci.events_rule
```

# Events and IAM Policies

Write policies for the Events service, including authorizations for non-administrator users and the Events service itself.

If you're new to policies, see [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/policiesgs/get-started-with-policies.htm) and [Common Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/policiescommon/commonpolicies.htm). For more details about how to write IAM policy for Events, see [Details for the Events Service](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/policyreference/cloudeventspolicyreference.htm).

## Allow Users to Work with Rules 🔗

These IAM policies allow users to manage or list rules.

### Let Users List Rules in a Compartment 🔗

**Type of access:** Ability to list Events rules.

**Where to create the policy:** In the tenancy.

Copy

```
Allow group RuleReaders to read cloudevents-rules in tenancy
```

The preceding policy allows RuleReaders to list rules in the tenancy.

### Let Admins Manage Rules in a Compartment 🔗

**Type of access:** Ability to manage Events rules, including creating, deleting, updating or moving rules to a different compartment.

**Where to create the policy:** In the tenancy.

This line gives the user inspect access to resources in compartments to select actions.

Copy

```
allow group <RuleAdmins> to inspect compartments in tenancy
```

This line gives the user access to defined tags to apply filter tags to rules.

Copy

```
allow group <RuleAdmins> to use tag-namespaces in tenancy
```

These lines give the user access to Streaming resources for actions

Copy

```
allow group <RuleAdmins> to inspect streams in tenancy
allow group <RuleAdmins> to use stream-push in tenancy
allow group <RuleAdmins> to use stream-pull in tenancy
```

These lines give the user access to Functions resources for actions.

Copy

```
allow group <RuleAdmins> to use virtual-network-family in tenancy
allow group <RuleAdmins> to manage function-family in tenancy
```

This line give the user access to Notifications topics for actions.

Copy

```
allow group <RuleAdmins> to use ons-topic in tenancy
```

This line gives the user manage access to rules for Events.

Copy

```
allow group <RuleAdmins> to manage cloudevents-rules in tenancy
```

### Allow Cross-tenancy Deliveries 🔗

Cross-tenancy delivery lets you to trigger an action in a different tenancy from the Events rules. Adjust the permissions on the action use case as needed. Use the following policies to enable cross-tenancy delivery.

**Type of access:** Ability to trigger actions that are in a different tenancy from the Events rules.

**Where to create the policy:** In the rule tenancy.

```
define tenancy action_tenancy as <action_tenancy_ocid>
endorse any-user to {ONS_TOPIC_PUBLISH, FN_INVOCATION, STREAM_READ, STREAM_PRODUCE} in tenancy action_tenancy where request.principal.type = 'eventrule'
```

**Where to create the policy:** In the action tenancy.

```
define tenancy rule_tenancy as <rule_tenancy_ocid>
admit any-user of tenancy rule_tenancy to {ONS_TOPIC_PUBLISH, FN_INVOCATION, STREAM_READ, STREAM_PRODUCE} in tenancy where request.principal.type = 'eventrule'
```

For more details on cross-tenancy policies, see [Cross-tenancy Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/database-tools/doc/cross-tenancy-policies.html).

Updated 2025-06-13
**Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Events** is a service that allows you to create some automation base on change of state in a service, or maybe based in some sort of input received. Now, let get a step back, and _Event_ is the occurrence of a particular situation. For this situations to be useful, events needs to be with some kind of information, for example, instance name, object name, status code, etc. The information can provide the automation something to work with.

**Events** are the base of serverless architecture, sometimes also referred to **event-driven architecture**. Additionally, events are crucial for contemporary software architectures as enables to decouple services, help to make software **asynchronous calls** and facilitate scaling processes.

#### An example of an event driven architecture:

- You develop an **image processing app**.
- Everytime a new image is uploaded to a bucket **it triggers an event**.
- This event calls a **function** that grab that image and create a thumbnail **from it**.
- The **thumbnail** is stored in another bucket.
- This triggers another event that **sends an email notification** to the client.

**NOTE** OCI function is a serverless solution from OCI, that allows you to run a single purpose software without provisioning hardware or VMs, the software runs base on an event or a schedule job, it is like having functions as a service. More from Functions [HERE](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Functions/Concepts/functionsoverview.htm)

### Getting back to OCI Events, some of the important characteristics are:

* * *

- **Event service use JSON object to define the event rules**.
You can think of a **rule like the filter** that will determine which events are important to consider, to determine what are going to be your inputs. Basically, **Rules triggers actions**. An example of a rule logic can be:


```
MATCH event WHERE (
  eventType EQUALS ANY OF (
  com.oraclecloud.computeapi.launchinstance.end
  )
)
```

Enter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode

This event will trigger when a new [compute instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Concepts/computeoverview.htm#:~:text=An%20Oracle%20Cloud%20Infrastructure%20VM,software%20stack%2C%20and%20networking%20infrastructure.) is created

##### But...

**Where is the JSON part??**

On the event, itself, let see an example of an event:

```
{
  "eventType": "com.oraclecloud.computeapi.launchinstance.end",
  "cloudEventsVersion": "0.1",
  "eventTypeVersion": "2.0",
  "source": "ComputeApi",
  "eventTime": "2019-08-16T12:07:42.794Z",
  "contentType": "application/json",
  "data": {
    "compartmentId": "ocid1.compartment.oc1..unique_ID",
    "compartmentName": "example_compartment",
    "resourceName": "my_instance",
    "resourceId": "ocid1.instance.oc1.phx.unique_ID",
    "availabilityDomain": "availability_domain",
    "additionalDetails": {
      "imageId": "ocid1.image.oc1.phx.unique_ID",
      "shape": "VM.Standard2.1",
      "type": "CustomerVmi"
    }
  },
  "eventID": "unique_ID",
  "extensions": {
    "compartmentId": "ocid1.compartment.oc1..unique_ID"
  }
}
```

Enter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode

This is an example of an instance that have been just created, and will trigger the event.

* * *

- **You can add conditions or filters to further narrow your events**.

During an event rule configuration, you can add some attributes to further filter your results

[![Adding attribute to the rule](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fzpnrovo3flyxnhuocb40.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fzpnrovo3flyxnhuocb40.png)

**On this example** we are filtering results from the event type, for changes only on **Sandbox and dev** compartments, the whole logic looks like:

```
MATCH event WHERE (
  eventType EQUALS ANY OF (
  com.oraclecloud.computeapi.launchinstance.end
  )
  AND (
  compartmentName MATCHES ANY OF (
  Sandbox,
  dev
  )
 )
)
```

Enter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode

Additional to this, we can add **Filter conditions** based on Tags

```
MATCH event WHERE (
  eventType EQUALS ANY OF (
  com.oraclecloud.computeapi.launchinstance.end
  )
  AND (
  compartmentName MATCHES ANY OF (
  Sandbox,
  dev
  )
  definedTags INCLUDES ANY OF (
  Oracle-Tags.CreatedBy.elopez
  )
 )
)
```

Enter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode

Visually something like:

[![Rule conditions configuration](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F37afhkz6yk5g4kykfvr3.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F37afhkz6yk5g4kykfvr3.png)

**Basically** this event will trigger everytime an instance is launch on _Sandbox_ OR _dev_ compartments by the user _elopez_.

* * *

- **Rules most specify and action**.

The main objective for the rules is to provoke something when they are triggered, otherwise will be useless.

**Actions are responses defined for event matched**

Actions can be created using:

**[Notifications](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Notification/home.htm#top)** send the messages to a notification service which can send it to endpoints that are subscribe to the topic

[![notifications](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Frhfx6lgpbd97ekk5gx90.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Frhfx6lgpbd97ekk5gx90.png)

These could be: an email address, email group, slack channel, etc.

**[Streaming](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Streaming/home.htm#top)** using this service you will ingest your events into a data streams to obtain further analysis and intelligence over this data.

**[Functions](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Functions/Concepts/functionsoverview.htm#Overview_of_Functions)** functions can be executed based on events received. **Quick example:**

> you can have an event that triggers every time a new instance is created and this will execute a function that configure monitoring for that new instance.

* * *

- **You need to add permissions so the Events service can call the action services**.

**Take into consideration** any action is deny by default on OCI so you will need to create a policy that permit the Events service to execute the actions.

Basic permission you will need is:

```
Allow service cloudEvents to use ons-topic in tenancy
Allow service cloudEvents to use functions-family in tenancy
```

Enter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode

This is for the _Tenancy_ but you can assign it to an specific _Compartment_

```
Allow service cloudEvents to use ons-topic in compartment DEV
Allow service cloudEvents to use functions-family in compartment DEV
```

Enter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode

# OCI Events Service – perform actions when events happen in your services

Oracle Events Service in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure came available in OCI Console recently, I was part of the limited availability program but couldn’t test it as much as I wanted since the service was only available on certain US region where we didn’t have any use at that point in time. However right now it seems to be available on number of regions.

So what is Events Service? There are number of cases when a resource state changes in your OCI tenancy which you might need to be either notified or actioned further when they happen. Let’s say a resource is created in certain compartment and you want to be notified for this using the Notification Service. Or when a new user is created you want to perform further actions using the Functions Service. If you have been using Amazon Web Services this is similar to the CloudWatch Events so nothing new here so far.

The the actions you can use when the resource state changes are: Notifications, Functions or Streaming service.

Currently Events Service seems to support two types of services, the Database service and the Object Storage service. At this point in time Database service supports only Autonomous Database services including the Autonomous Exadata Service. I’m hoping the normal Exadata service will be introduced later as for me one interesting use case is to use Events Service when scaling event happens in our OCI Exadata.

Events such as instance creation and deletion, maintenance notification and start/end are included. Which is good! I’ve been annoyed by the fact you can’t get any info on the maintenance start and stop other than those emails which sometimes don’t arrive to your mailbox.

For Object Storage it includes usual actions against buckets and objects. This will be my sample case also on this post, getting notified when a new bucket is created.

#### Use Events Service to get notification when a bucket is created in Object Storage

Simple test case to start with, if anyone creates a bucket in my tenancy I want to get notified by email. Since we are using the Notification Service I will need a new Topic to be created which will be called MyObjectStorageNotification. I have an older post about Notification Service in [here](https://www.thatfinnishguy.blog/2019/05/14/use-oci-notification-service-to-get-informed-on-your-autonomous-database-scaling-events/), but in short once the topic has been created you need to subscribe into it with your email and click the email the service sends to verify the subscription.

![](https://www.thatfinnishguy.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/events1-1024x475.png)Creating Notification Topic

After this I can go to Events Service and Create Rule, my rule will be called CreateBucketEvent and it will be launched each time a bucket is created in my tenancy.

![](https://www.thatfinnishguy.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/events3-1024x341.png)Creating Rule in Events Service

I could also add multiple Event Types so for example all matching Object Storage actions which includes actions againsts Buckets or Objects. You can see also the logic on the right side of the screen. As an action I use the previously used MyObjectStorageNotification. Once I’m ready I can click the Test Rule to see if sample event matches my rule.

![](https://www.thatfinnishguy.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/events4-1024x510.png)Test Rule in Events Service

At this point I thought I was ready to create my first rule but I didn’t review the Policy Prerequisites which are highlighted in the screen when creating the rule.

#### Required Policies

As highlighted you will need to create policies for users and actions. Clicking the expansion shows you what policies you need to have which serves as a good starting point. Remember it’s not only policies for groups but also the Events service itself so it can use the other services required.

![](https://www.thatfinnishguy.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/events5-1024x248.png)Required Policies for Events Service![](https://www.thatfinnishguy.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/events6-1024x726.png)Creating required policy to use Events Service

After creating policies I was able to create my first rule in the Events Service. Once created it displays the details and Metrics of the rule.

![](https://www.thatfinnishguy.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/events7-1024x484.png)Event Details and Metrics

#### Creating bucket and adding a condition for the rule

Since my initial rule was to get notified when a bucket is created I did that and within few seconds received the email on my mailbox.

![](https://www.thatfinnishguy.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Inkedevents8_LI-1024x801.jpg)Event Notification email after Bucket has been created

But I don’t really want to be notified on all buckets created within my tenancy. I want to be notified only when certain conditions are being met. There is possibility to use attributes with the rule so for example I can be notified only when specific compartmentId matches. In this case I edit the rule and add the attribute, I could also add other attributes like AvailabilityDomain or compartmentName. Or we can edit the rule and add condition to filter with Tags.

![](https://www.thatfinnishguy.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/events10-1024x241.png)Adding an Attribute for conditition

Once I added the rule I tried to test the rule in similar way as earlier, but in this case the sample events data does not match so I can’t verify it. However once I create the bucket I only get notification when the rule matches and bucket is created in the specific compartment which I defined.

#### Summary

Events Service is a great addition to growing number of services in OCI and something I’ve been waiting for some time already! Hopefully in the upcoming months they add more available services which are linked together with Events Service so there will be more use cases for it.

Although this post concentrated on the Notifications I’m more excited on using the Functions Service together with this. This gives more options on the automation of your infrastructure and performing multiple events based when a resource state changes.

1. can events be used to get notified when a bucket is not encrypted?

1. I think you can filter on anything based on what is on the event JSON file but each object is already encrypted by default and can’t be turned off so I guess you wouldn’t need to monitor it?



      Read more on here about filtering: [https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Concepts/filterevents.htm](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Concepts/filterevents.htm)

2. Excellent post, Simo. I played around with the create/delete object events, too. After it not working I realized that you have to enable the bucket to emit events.


I assume you added the action policies in the root compartment, correct?



Cheers!

1. Ok it seems I have all my demo buckets set as “disabled” to emit events and I can’t recall this would have been needed during the time of the test. Perhaps this was added later on? I need to edit my post then!



      Also the policies were added to root compartment, good catch. 🙂
